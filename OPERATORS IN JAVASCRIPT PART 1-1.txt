OPERATORS IN JAVASCRIPT
PART 1


Question 1:- Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming?


Answer:- Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform operations on operands. Operands can be variables, values, or expressions. Operators are essential in prorammin because they allow us to manipulate data and perform calculations.


They are essentia in programming languages as it can be used to


* perform Arithmetic operation.
* Assin operator.
* Compare Operator.
* Perform loical operations


Question 2 :- Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for each category?


Answer:- Operators in JavaScript are cateorized based on their functionality into the following groups:
1. Arithmetic Operators: These operators perform mathematical operations on operands. Operands can be numbers or variables.


// Addition (+)
const sum = 1 + 2; // sum is now equal to 3


// Subtraction (-)
const difference = 10 - 5; // difference is now equal to 5


// Multiplication (*)
const product = 3 * 4; // product is now equal to 12


// Division (/)
const quotient = 12 / 3; // quotient is now equal to 4


// Exponentiation (**)
const power = 2 ** 3; // power is now equal to 8


// Modulo (%)
const remainder = 10 % 3; // remainder is now equal to 1


2.  Assignment Operators: These operators assin values to variables.


// Assignment operator (=)
const myVariable = 10;


// Addition assignment operator (+=)
myVariable += 5; // myVariable is now equal to 15


// Subtraction assignment operator (-=)
myVariable -= 5; // myVariable is now equal to 10


// Multiplication assignment operator (*=)
myVariable *= 2; // myVariable is now equal to 20


// Division assignment operator (/=)
myVariable /= 2; // myVariable is now equal to 10


// Modulo assignment operator (%=)
myVariable %= 3; // myVariable is now equal to 1




3. Comparison Operators: These operators compare two values and return a Boolean value (true or false).


// Equal to (==)
const isEqual = 10 == 10; // isEqual is now equal to true


// Not equal to (!=)
const isNotEqual = 10 != 10; // isNotEqual is now equal to false


// Greater than (>)
const isGreaterThan = 10 > 5; // isGreaterThan is now equal to true


// Less than (<)
const isLessThan = 10 < 5; // isLessThan is now equal to false


// Greater than or equal to (>=)
const isGreaterThanOrEqual = 10 >= 10; // isGreaterThanOrEqual is now equal to
true


// Less than or equal to (<=)
const isLessThanOrEqual = 10 <= 5; // isLessThanOrEqual is now equal to false


4.  Logical Operators: These operators perform logical operations on Boolean values.


// AND (&&)
const isAndTrue = true && true; // isAndTrue is now equal to true
const isAndFalse = true && false; // isAndFalse is now equal to false


// OR (||)
const isOrTrue = true || false; // isOrTrue is now equal to true
const isOrFalse = false || false; // isOrFalse is now equal to false


// NOT (!)
const isNotTrue = !true; // isNotTrue is now equal to false
const isNotFalse = !false; // isNotFalse is now equal to true


Question 3 :- Differentiate between unary, and binary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.


Answer:- Operators in JavaScript are categorized based on the number of operands they required into the following groups.


1. Unary operatorso Unary operators operate on a single operand
2. Binary operatorso Binary operators operate on two operands.


Unary operators in JavaScript are:


// Unary Plus (+)
let num = 10;
let result = +num; // result will be 10 (positive value of num)


// Unary Negation (-)
let negativeNum = -5;
let positiveValue = -negativeNum; // positiveValue will be 5


// Increment (++)
let x = 5;
x++; // x becomes 6


// Decrement (--)
let y = 10;
y--; // y becomes 9
Binary operators in JavaScript are:


// Addition (+)
let sum = 5 + 3; // sum will be 8


// Subtraction (-)
let difference = 10 - 4; // difference will be 6


// Multiplication (*)
let product = 3 * 4; // product will be 12


// Division (/)
let quotient = 20 / 5; // quotient will be 4


// Assignment (=)
let a = 10; // assigning value 10 to variable a


Question 4 :- Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts important?


Answer:- Precedence refers to the order in which operators are evaluated when multiple operators are present in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are executed first. For example, in the expression 3 + 5 * 2, multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+), so the multiplication is performed first


const result = 3 + 5 * 2; // The result will be 13, not 16 (if addition had higher precedence)


Associativity refers to the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated. Some operators associate left to right, meaning they are evaluated from left to right. Others associate right to left, meaning they are evaluated from right to left.


const result = 10 + 5 + 2; // The result will be 17 (evaluated as (10 + 5) + 2)


Understanding precedence and associativity is important for several reasons:


* Correct Expression Evaluation: Understanding the order of precedence ensures that expressions are evaluated correctly, preventing potential errors or unexpected results.
* Predictable Code: When working with complex expressions, knowing the precedence and associativity allows developers to write code that behaves as intended, making it easier to reason about and maintain
* Debugging and Troubleshooting: In case of unexpected results, knowing operator precedence and associativity helps in debugging and identifying the root cause of issues
* Optimizing Code: Knowledge of precedence and associativity can be used to optimize code by avoiding unnecessary parentheses and ensuring efficient computation.
Question 5 :- Write a JavaScript program that calculates the simple interest using the formula Simple interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100.


Answer:-         const principal = 1000
const rate = 5
const time = 2 // in years


const result = (principal * rate * time)/100


console.log("Simple Interest =", result)


Question 6 :- Write a Javascript program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula BMI = weight (kg)/ height * height.


Answer:-         const height = 160 // in cm
const weight = 55 // in kg


const BMI = weight/ height * height


console.log("BMI =", BMI)


Question 7 :- Write a program in JavaScript to calculate the area of a circle given its radius value of 10. Use appropriate arithmetic operators.


Answer:-         const radius = 10; // Radius of the circle


// Calculate the area of the circle: area = π * radius^2
const pi = Math.PI; // Approximate value of pi
const area = pi * Math.pow(radius, 2);


console.log("Area of the circle:", area);
